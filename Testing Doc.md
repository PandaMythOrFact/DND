# Choose Your Character:

Please make your character using the following:
- Level 1 of any class, using 2024 rules (No Artificer plz)
- Choose 1 of the 4 Hooks for your character.
- Create a backstory and feel free to connect yourself to other players' backstories, but ***tell them first***.
- Ask me questions if you really don't know what to include.

## Choose your Hooks:

The **Hooks** describe why your character is traveling to Phandalin and what might motivate them to get involved in the unfolding events. Your **Background** is your character's personal history, helping define where you come from and what shaped you before embarking on this journey. Both the hook and background should work together to shape your character.

> [!info] **Character Creation Tip:**
> Think about how your **Background** and **Hook** might influence the decisions you make in-game. How do they define your character's personality or motivations?
